# Automating NSX with Terraform

Examples here uses NSX-T Policy API. 

In all iterations, at the end of the Terraform script, there is a static route added to the Ubuntu host which is basically a VM connected to the same VLAN which the Tier0 uplink is connected to. It is purely optional and that section can be deleted if desired.


## Iteration-2

This example implements an active / standby Tier 0 configuration with Tier 1 and an overlay segment attached to Tier 1. The overlay segment has a DHCP configured. For now there does not seem to be support for HA VIP config on Tier 0. Hence that needs to be configured manually.

## Iteration-TKG

This example also provisions the same topology as iteration 1 and 2, however it has the Github based binaries for NSX Plugin for Terraform and configures the environment for VNware TKG installation. It usese VLAN ID = 0 for Tier 0 uplink vlan segment. Credit goes to [@jayunit100](https://github.com/jayunit100)

### Using The NSX-T Provider on Github

NSX Provider for Terraform is continuously developed and maintained by VMware on [Github](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nsxt#developing-the-provider). For the latest features you would want to download it from the above URL and manually compile it. For manual installation of the provider the instructions are [here](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nsxt#manual-installation).

The version that Terraform automatically pulls when you perform "terraform init" is the GA version of the code and may not have the latest features.
